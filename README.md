# Darko's Terraform Adventure

![header](/assets/githubheader.png)

If you are stumbling onto this repository looking for an awesome Terraform
project, you **may** be in the wrong place. But in any case, welcome! This
repository serves as a single point of reference for a
[series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbTckSyY9fPYgIYnIAfHmhyXLAHHCQ8LA)
of Twitch/Youtube streams that I am doing on the topic of Terraform.

Here is the gist of it:
I am, by no means, an expert in Terraform - and by that I mean, I've tried it
once. So I use this opportunity to learn Terraform and share my learning path
with the wider community.

I will be spliting the updates here based on episodes or parts of the stream so
its easier to follow.
Make sure to join me the streams I do every week - the topics of those streams
are revolving around AWS and Cloud Technologies, but do expect a lot of code
and fun stuff as well.

## Episode 01

Link to the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/4zvueYsCcoo).

In the first episode we were going down with the basics:

- Installing Terraform on my laptop
- Creating our first `hello_world` application/project.

On top of just doing the simple `hello_world` example, we expanded on it and did
some modifications.
What can you expect from the code here is:

- That we have created a VPC with a subnet.
- A single EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2
- That EC2 instance is running as a Web Server - to be precise it has Apache
  running on it.
